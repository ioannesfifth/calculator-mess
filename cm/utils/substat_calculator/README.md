1. For every possibility of a substat roll, find the average per substat e.g. the average of a flat hp substat is 253

2. Decide on substat budget. I decided on 40 since my XL has roughly 42 relevant substats.

3. Decide on ER needs. Calculate the amount of rolls it would require by dividing it by the average er roll and round.

4. Decide on a reasonable CV. This should mimic how people actually check artis (lmao cv simps). Do similar to ER. Divide it by 2 and give each to cr and cd. Round. If it's not even, feel free to add 1 to cr or cd. It's very hard to skew your crit rolls if most have both cr and cd.

5. List down your remaining relevant substats and how important they are via weights (I like not weighting them unless it's really important like Nahida EM). Substat budget - er or cr or whatever else important substats you removed. Distribute via the weights. Anything without a weight gets an equal share of 1 - sum of defined weights. Round.

6. Double check if everything seems right, give +-1 if the rounding made the sum not equal 40.

7. Multiply everything by the avg substat rolls

8. Slap it on the calculator. Feel free to have the crit hat mainstat adjust for a better ratio. Don't be bothered too much by how it's technically not possible to get some of these stats, they are averages after all.
